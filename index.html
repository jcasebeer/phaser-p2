<h2>Tank Catz</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
</br>
Control 4 different cat's simaltaneously to win the war and save your cactuses!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
</br>
Players should feel overwhelmed by having to control each aspect of </br>
the tank manually by switching between cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
First person shooter / arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

The player must pilot the tank through the eyes of each of its cuddly crew members. </br>
The player can change viewpoints with the z key, shoot with x, steer their tank with the </br> arrow keys, and independently aim with the a and d keys. </br> The main goal
in the game is surviving the onslaught of enemy tanks using these skills. </br>
If I had more time I would have added two more cats, one which the player needs to use to sweep for mines, and another which can repair the tank. </br> The goal of the control 
layout was to make the player have to stretch their hands out as uncomfortably as</br> 
possible to control each of the cats.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
pseduo 3d graphics </br>
complicated control scheme </br>
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
infinite, persistent field of cacti </br>
weird controls </br>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
There are 4 cats in a tank, there are other tanks that want to kill you, and you are living in cactus land. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is targeted at people who like cats, cactuses, and tanks.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Infinite at the moment. (no end state)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
</br>
One good strategy is to have a friend steer the tank while you shoot the guns!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the assets are from scratch except for the meow sound effect. I also recycled the shooting and explosion sounds from the previous project.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
